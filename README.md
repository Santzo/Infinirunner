Infinirunner is an endless side-scrolling shooter game. The difficulty of the game gradually increases by the game throwing new and more enemies at you. The game will always end up in the player's death. 

The player is awarded points for killing enemies, his average speed and survival time. Killing enemies while going fast gives more points. The player can also find health orbs to replenish lost health and boost orbs to get temporary invincibility.

This game is my first Android game ever and it took me about 2,5 weeks to finish it.
